## 2018 104hackathon - AppWebService    
We use the data that include user searching keyword to evaluate the welfare is bad or good.     
Different keyword would get a different result.   
Such as if you searching "React" or "Front-end".   <br />
Maybe we will get a completely different result of welfare score.
